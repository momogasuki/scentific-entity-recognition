The existence of an assumption calls for the imagination of a counterfactual context before inferring the answer , pushing the NDR model to grasp both semantic understanding and counterfactual thinking .
However , it does not explicitly maintain other attributes between the source and translated text , for e.g. , text length and descriptiveness .
Following the standard structure of the transformer , we build up guided - attention block and selfattention block where each block consists of each attention operation with layer normalization , residual connection , and a single feed - forward layer .
The soft attention over the knowledge facts and the given question is computed as follows : p ij = softmax(q T i−1 m ij ) where m is the embeddings of knowledge facts , i is a number of layer and j is an index of knowledge facts .
Moreover , to guarantee the student learning performance , we also propose a weighting strategy to take into consideration the reliability of the teachers .

Moreover , we believe that the following iterations can be achieved by the current L2I module in an iterative manner .
Building on the progress of supervised transfer models , recent works have focused on unsupervised style transfer that avoids costly annotation of parallel sentences .
However , it is difficult to capture multi - hop relationships containing long - distance nodes from the graph due to the well - known over - smoothing problem , where repetitive message passing process to propagate information across long distance makes features of connected nodes too similar and undiscriminating ( Li et al . , 2018 ; .
Our method , which builds on top of pseudo - labeling , is conceptually simple and improves pseudo - labeling across different summarization datasets .

Specifically , each token is encoded with two positional ids .
If the length l is unknown , we may need to enumerate all possible lengths , since BERT needs to change the number of [ MASK ] tokens according to the length .
However , for arithmetic questions , the question - answering label for one pair of c and q remains the same between TAT - HQA and TAT - QA , and the intervention is achieved explicitly by deriving operators and tagging head .
Results with the Transformer student ( the sixth block ) follow a similar trend , although the improvements are smaller .
It corresponds to the simplest imagination since the assumed value ( i.e. , c i ) is explicitly mentioned in the assumption .
We also find that BART does not perform well on the challenging SuperGLUE benchmark .
, in a given sentence .
We also study the contribution of 2D positional encoding to long text generation .
We train Transformer for 100 epochs and select the best model w.r.t .
GLM
This goes to show that having the right reward function to guide the budget of the gradient update process to reach the true objective is important in extremely low resource setting .
We notice that GLM Doc slightly underperforms GLM Large , which is consistent with our observations in the seq2seq experiments .
All our models are trained on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs .
o ∈ R O is a distribution over the operators where O denotes the number of operators .
Meanwhile , HAN employs stochastic graph walk in a knowledge and question graph to encode high - order semantics ( e.g. , knowledge facts and question phrases ) , and considers attention scores between knowledge facts and question phrases .
In classification tasks , it is typically done by minimizing the distance between the teacher and student predictions ( Hinton et al . , 2015 ) .
wherep j ∈ { 0 , 1 } denotes the label of the target fact ( token j in context ) or the premise ( token j in assumption ) ; andō ∈ R O is the label of the deriving operator ( see Appendix C for the details of label construction).Readers might have raised the following two concerns for L2I : 1 ) the operators defined are limited , and 2 ) the operators are tailored to one step of derivation on one target fact .
Existing models can be separated into three categories , shared feature space based , translation based and knowledge distillation based .
Position 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 3 3 Position 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 1 2
However , both models require more parameters to outperform autoencoding models such as RoBERTa .
This work is supported partly by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and by the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment .
In particular , we adopt a tagging head to identify the premise and a multi - way classifier for choosing operators , which is formulated as : o = sof tmax(MLP(h CLS ) ) .
When both data and code are provided , the number of potential causes of such differences is limited , and the NLP field has shared increasingly detailed information about system , dependencies and evaluation to chase down sources of differences .
x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 1 x 2 [ M ] x 4 [ M ] [ S ] x 5 x 6 [ S ] x 3 x 5 x 6 [ E ] x 3 [ E ] x 1 x 2 [ M ] x 4 [ M ] [ S ] x 5 x 6 [ S ] x 3 x 1 x 2 [ M ]
A low BLEU score and relatively high inform and success rate might indicate greedy agent behaviour .
The margin µ of the activation transfer loss was set to 1.0 .
To construct the text infilling task , we randomly mask a given ratio r ∈ { 10 % • • • 50 % } of each document 's tokens and the contiguous masked tokens are collapsed into a single blank .
We present the attention map from the guided - attention block , and visualize top - k attended knowledge facts or entities with the attention scores .
In calibrated teacher training , we first select the number of epochs and the learning rate as the default values of the BioBERT code and slightly change the number of epochs ( e ) for the unreported tasks from BioBERT .
The detailed equation of gated recurrent propagation is as follows : h
Sharing code and data together with detailed information about them is now expected as standard , and checklists and datasheets have been proposed to standardise information sharing ( Pineau , 2020;Shimorina and Belz , 2021 ) .
This situation is more severe for zero - resource languages .
Translation based models generate pseudo labeled target language data to train the cross - lingual NER model , but the noise from translation process restrains its performance .
[ M ]
The dataset has 10438 dialogues split into 8438 dialogues for training set and 1000 dialogues each for validation and test set .
To facilitate the evaluation of HQA and diagnose counterfactual thinking , we construct an HQA dataset based on TAT - QA ( Zhu et al . , 2021 ) , which is a QA dataset with a mix of tabular and textual context extracted from financial reports .
It clearly demonstrates the advantage of our method in NLU tasks .
Especially , when we convert the one of both hyperedge - level representation to single - word - unit - based representation , the mean accuracy of QA is 82.7 % and 88.7 % , respectively .

In this paper , we proposed Hypergraph Transformer for multi - hop reasoning over knowledge graph under weak supervision .
The results for models trained on BookCorpus and Wikipedia are shown in Tables 3 and 4 .
However , generative models require much more parameters to work due to the limit of unidirectional attention .
Within one training batch , we sample short spans and longer spans ( document - level or sentence - level ) with equal chances .
These methods , while capable of achieving the target domain characteristics , often fail to maintain the invariant content .
Simpsons " as the character captain Billy Higgledypig , but his character was only a one - time recurring character in the series ' first six seasons .
Note that we only change the teacher 's attention temperature during inference time .
It derives the intervention result for the target fact .
The comparison results are shown in Table 4 .
3 The resulting numbers of document - summary pairs for training , validation , and test are 287,227 , 13,368 , and 11,490 , respectively .
Moreover , compared with the latest model TOF , RIKD , Unitrans , our model requires much lower computational costs for both translation and iterative knowledge distillation , meanwhile reaching superior performance .
Also , our model shows significant improvement in spatial question compared to other models .
Following ( Tjong Kim Sang , 2002 ) , we use the entity level F1 - score as the evaluation metric .
For activation boundary distillation , we first fine - tuned the initial student model for 5 - 10 epochs with learning rates of { 6e-6 , 8e-6 , 1e-5 } .
RoBERTa 's performance was already similar to the teacher model in the initial fine - tuning stage because it was pre - trained with more data than BERT and exhibited a greater robustness .
We now describe our pretraining setup and the evaluation of downstream tasks .
To evaluate a pure reasoning ability of the models , we conduct experiments in the oracle setting .
With the release of multi - domain , multi - turn Multi - Woz2.0 dataset ( Budzianowski et al . , 2018a ) , there has been flurry of recent works , of which Zhang et al . ( 2019 ) uses data augmentation .
Two - step Formulation .
)
We truncate all documents and summaries to 1024 sub - word tokens .
The contents of this appendix are as follows : In Section A , we show the detailed statistics for the diverse splits of four benchmark datasets , i.e. , KVQA , FVQA , PQ and PQL .
All models except ours show slightly lower performance on the 3 - hop graph than on the 2 - hop graph .
The evaluation metrics are the scores of BLEU-1 , BLEU-2 , BLEU-3 , BLEU-4 ( Papineni et al . , 2002 ) , METEOR ( Denkowski and Lavie , 2014 ) and Rouge - L ( Lin , 2004 ) .
We start below with the concepts and definitions that QRA is based on , followed by an overview of the framework ( Section 3.2 ) and steps in applying it in practice ( Section 3.3).The International Vocabulary of Metrology ( VIM ) ( JCGM , 2012 ) defines repeatability and reproducibility as follows ( defined terms in bold , see VIM for subsidiary defined terms ):
