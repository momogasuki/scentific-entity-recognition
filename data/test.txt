Recently , transformer ( Vaswani et al . , 2017)-based language models have been successfully applied in the field of natural language processing ( NLP ) .
( 4 ) In order to maximize syntactic and lexical diversity of the pairs of paraphrased sentences , we perform an analysis based on word overlap between the semantically similar pair sentences ( i.e. , the output of the previous step ) .
We demonstrate these gains over three datasets : YELP ( Zhao et al . , 2018b ) , IMDB ( Dai et al . , 2019 ) and POLITICAL ( Prabhumoye et al . , 2018 ) , generating six constraints including lexical , syntactic and domainspecific constraints .
For example , sentences of similar lengths ( irrespective of their domains ) should be closer together .

We validate the model performance on the three commonly - used datasets across 7 languages and the experimental results show the superiority of our presented MTMT model .
These are MSR - Paraphrase ( 510 pairs ) , MSR - Video ( 368 pairs ) , and SMTeuroparl ( 203 pairs ) .
On the two benchmarks , GLM can still outperform BERT with the same amount of parameters , but with a smaller margin .
We control the memory size through |M | = store ratio × |D s | .
For similarity - based answer , we calculate a dot product similarity p = zC T between z and answer candidate set C ∈ R |A|×w where |A| is a number of candidate answers and w is a dimension of representation for each answer .
ii ) Syntactic : Presence of personal pronouns ( binarized to indicate the presence of a personal pronoun ) ; number of adjectives ( categorical up to 5 ) ; number of proper nouns ( categorical up to 3 ) ; syntactic tree height ( categorical up to 10 ) .
The hyperparameters for GLM Doc and GLM Sent are the same as those of GLM Large .
Each dialogue is generated by users with a defined goal which may cover 1 - 5 domains with a maximum of 13 turns in a conversation .
) . To build these memory slots , we select samples from support sets and write their information into the memory .
The only difference is the number of spans and the span lengths .
We also add a few refinement steps to refine the classification layer of the student model .
AraT5 Models Release .
Specifically , given the key representation K q j of a sample X q j ∈ D q i , we retrieve the top N most similar slots from its task - specific memory M i .
The source code of KaFSP is available at https : //github.com / tjunlp - lab / KaFSP .
Each of Tables D.3 , D.4 , and D.5 ( Appendix D ) shows two output samples from our paraphrasing , transliteration , and title generation models , respectively .
We thus believe that TAGOP - L2I can generalize well to more deriving operations by simply incorporating the operators , as long as the corresponding training questions are not rare .
That may be the reason why multiple continuous spans of text are copied .
The scores across all settings drop when GA or SA is removed .
As we proposed , applying both calibrated teacher training and activation boundary distillation resulted in a superior performance .
β is tuned to 1 ( chosen from { 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 } ) .
During inference , as common wisdom , we apply beam search .
Specifically , we train a recognizer to output a sequence of symbols consisting of either fingerspelled letters or a special non - fingerspelling symbol < x > .
It projects the raw content into latent representation .
Hence we create ARGEN CST , our code - switched translation benchmark component , using four sub - test sets .
2 ) PQ and PQL datasets have annotations of a ground - truth reasoning path to answer a given question .
Formally , it is to learn a function y = f ( q , c ) , where y , q , and c are the word list representing the answer , the question , and the context 2 respectively .
This student is randomly initialized and denoted by Transformer .
The input of the key network is the sample input sentence X s j ∈ D s i ( X q j ∈ D q i ) , and the output is the encoded representation of the first token ( i.e. [ CLS ] token ) of the sentence .
Fot the text summarization task , we use the dataset Gigaword ( Rush et al . , 2015 ) for model fine - tuning and evaluation .
RoBERTa 's performance was already similar to the teacher model in the initial fine - tuning stage because it was pre - trained with more data than BERT and exhibited a greater robustness .
FWS and FVS respectively consist of detecting fingerspelled words within a given raw ASL video stream and detecting video clips of interest containing a given fingerspelled word .
In FSS - Net , the visual features output from convolutional layers are passed through a 1layer Bi - LSTM with 256 hidden units per direction to capture temporal information .
We follow the split of training , testing and validation set of TAT - QA as shown in Table 2 .
T5 uses independent positional encodings for the encoder and decoder , and relies on multiple sentinel tokens to differentiate the masked spans .
5.3 .
If the current subtask T is not finished within its time limit , we force the agent to re - select a new subtask T t ∈ T t \ { T } , regardless whether T is still available .
For evaluation , we introduce a novel benchmark for ARabic language GENeration ( ARGEN ) , covering seven important tasks .
We use string matching to only include tweets with at least 3 Arabic words , regardless whether the tweet has non - Arabic string or not .
Details about ARGEN NTG are in Table C.1 ( Appendix ) .
The ASL videos in the two datasets are collected from online resources and include a variety of viewpoints and styles , such as webcam videos and lectures .
The only difference between these two methods is that TAGOP - CLO incorporates an extra CLO .
The beam size , length penalty , and minimal length are 4 , 2.0 , and 55 on CNNDM ; 6 , 0.1 , and 1 on XSum ; and 4 , 0.7 , and 80 on NYT , respectively .
SuperGLUE .
In the meta - training process , we first train θ on a support set ( i.e. , a few training samples of a new task i ) to obtain task - specific parameters θ i .
We consider that the reason why Hypergraph Transformer failed to infer the correct answer despite focusing on the exact knowledge fact is that the correct answer word ( Myocardial Infarction ) appears rarely in QA pairs .
He appeared in the first few episodes of " " as the character major Jack Ryan .
The detailed description of this criterion is in Appendix .
Pretraining largescale language models significantly improves the performance of downstream tasks .
Entity linking setting We also present the experimental results on the entity linking setting where the named entities are not provided as the oracle setting , but detected by the module as described in Section 3.2 .
The Stories dataset is no longer publicly available 4 .
They report 57B Arabic tokens ( almost double our token size ) from 53 M webpages , making 1.66 % of all mT5 data .
Next , to generate sentences , we consider two decodersx src ∼ p φ ( x|z ) andx tgt ∼ p η ( x|z ) .
